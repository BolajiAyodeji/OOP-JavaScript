// Types of Inheritance

// Classical (In JavaScript, we don't have classes, we only have Objects).
// Prototypical

// It's important to note that there are no classes in JavaScript.
// Functions can be used to somewhat simulate classes, but in general JavaScript is a class-less language.
// Everything is an object.
// When it comes to inheritance, objects inherit from objects, not classes from classes as in the "class"-ical languages.
