# The four pillars of OOP

- ENCAPSULATION
- ABSTRACTION
- INHERITANCE
- POLYMORPHISM

## ENCAPSULATION
This is basically grouping related variables and functions that operate on them into Objects.

## ABSTRACTION
Helps to reduce the impact of change, hides complexity and chuns a simpler interface.

## INHERITANCE
A mechanism that helps to eliminate redundant code.

## POLYMORPHISM
Poly means many, morphism mean forms
A technique that helps to get ride of long if and else statements and switch cases.
